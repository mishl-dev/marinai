# MarinAI Configuration
# ============================================

# LLM Model Settings
# Controls how the language model generates responses
model_settings:
  temperature: 1        # Creativity/randomness (0.0 = deterministic, 2.0 = very random)
  top_p: 1              # Nucleus sampling threshold (1.0 = consider all tokens)

# Response Delays
# Timing controls for message processing
delays:
  message_processing: 1.5  # Seconds to wait before processing a message (anti-spam)

# Memory System Settings
# Controls how Marin remembers facts about users
memory:
  fact_aging_days: 7              # Days before old facts are considered for cleanup
  fact_summarization_threshold: 20  # Number of facts before triggering summarization
  maintenance_interval_hours: 24  # Hours between memory maintenance runs

# Typing Simulation Settings
# Makes Marin appear more human-like when typing
typing:
  base_chars_per_second: 25.0  # Base typing speed (humans average ~40 WPM ≈ 3.3 CPS)
  min_duration_ms: 800         # Minimum typing indicator duration in milliseconds
  max_duration_ms: 4000        # Maximum typing indicator duration in milliseconds
  variation: 0.3               # Random variation factor (0.3 = ±30% randomness)

# Loneliness / Boredom DM Settings
# Controls when Marin reaches out to inactive users
loneliness:
  inactivity_threshold_hours: 24  # Hours of user inactivity before eligible for DM
  loneliness_threshold_hours: 4   # Hours of global bot inactivity before checking users
  max_dm_attempts: 4              # Maximum DMs to send before giving up on a user
  check_interval_minutes: 60      # Minutes between loneliness checks

# Affection System Settings
# Controls the relationship/XP progression system
affection:
  max_affection: 25000                # Maximum affection points (XP cap) - ~1 week casual progression
  jealousy_threshold_days: 3          # Days of seeing user active elsewhere to trigger jealousy
  jealousy_penalty: -100              # Daily affection loss when feeling jealous
  random_event_chance: 0.05           # Chance of random affection events (0.05 = 5%)
  late_night_start_hour: 23           # Hour when late night bonus starts (23 = 11 PM)
  late_night_end_hour: 4              # Hour when late night bonus ends (4 = 4 AM)
  max_streak_days: 30                 # Days to reach maximum streak multiplier (2x)
  streak_break_penalty_per_day: 50    # XP lost per day of previous streak when broken
  max_streak_break_penalty: 2500      # Maximum XP penalty for breaking a streak

# Message Handling Settings
# Controls how messages are processed and filtered
messages:
  max_message_length: 280       # Maximum message length to process (longer = ignored)
  reply_score_threshold: 0.6    # Confidence score needed to auto-reply (0.0-1.0)
  cleanup_interval_hours: 1     # Hours between old reminder cleanup runs

# Storage / Database Settings
# Controls memory caching and similarity detection
storage:
  recent_messages_limit: 60     # Maximum recent messages to fetch per user for context
  recent_messages_keep: 30      # Number of messages to keep after cleanup runs
  duplicate_threshold: 0.8      # Similarity score to consider a memory as duplicate (0.0-1.0)
  similarity_threshold: 0.6     # Minimum similarity for memory search results (0.0-1.0)
  cleanup_probability: 0.1      # Probability of running cleanup per message (0.1 = 10%)
