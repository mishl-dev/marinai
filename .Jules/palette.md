## 2025-12-14 - Discord Embeds as "Visual Polish"

**Learning:**
In a Discord Bot context, "UI" is primarily composed of Embeds. Moving from plain text to Embeds for informational commands (like `/stats`) significantly improves the "Visual Polish" and perceived quality of the bot. It also allows for consistent color coding (Theme Colors) which builds brand identity (e.g., Pink for Affection, Blue for Memory).

**Action:**
When auditing Discord bots for UX, always check for "Wall of Text" responses that can be structured into Embeds with Titles, Fields, and Colors.
