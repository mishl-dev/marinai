# 💡 Future Ideas

Ideas for future improvements to Marin AI.

## 🖼️ Random Selfies
- Occasionally send generated "selfie" images using image generation
- Could trigger based on mood (FLIRTY sends more), time of day, or user request
- Use Gemini or another image gen API
- Maybe attach to boredom DMs for extra engagement

## 🎮 Advanced Mini-Games  
- More complex games beyond what users can just ask for
- Track scores/stats across sessions
- Leaderboards per server

## 🎤 Voice Channel Integration
- React when users join/leave voice channels
- "oh you're in vc? who you talking to~"
- Track time spent in voice

## 📊 Analytics Dashboard
- Web dashboard showing:
  - Most active users
  - Common topics
  - Mood distribution over time
  - Memory stats

## 🌐 Multi-Language Support
- Detect user language and respond accordingly
- Store language preference per user

## 🎭 Costume/Outfit System
- Different "outfits" that affect personality slightly
- Users can request outfit changes
- Seasonal outfits (Halloween, Christmas, etc.)
